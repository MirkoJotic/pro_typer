Q: What is it?

A: Nothing much. 100 most common words in English language are faling from the sky. If a word passes you, you lose 1 "life". You have five of those. You destroy falling words by typing them and hiting Enter. It's very rudimentary, for now, without any additional screens or pauses. The real game was making it :)
